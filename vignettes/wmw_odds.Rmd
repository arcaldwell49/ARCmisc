# Short Background

As an alternative, or in supplement to, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum/signed rank tests @agresti1980 and @wmw_odds have suggested a measure of effect size in the form of "odds". This can be considered as a transformation of the rank-biserial correlation or the concordance probability^[You can see this in blog posts by [Frank Harrell](https://www.fharrell.com/post/wpo/) or in the [effectsize R package](https://easystats.github.io/effectsize/) ]

# Implementation

This is implemented with the `wmw_odds` function. It is almost identical to `wilcox.test`

## Two sample

```{r}
data(sleep)

wmw_otest(extra ~ group,
         data = sleep)
```

## Paired samples

```{r}
data(sleep)

wmw_otest(extra ~ group,
         data = sleep,
         paired = TRUE)
```

## One sample

```{r}
data(sleep)

wmw_otest(sleep$extra)
```
